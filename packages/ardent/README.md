# Ardent

Ardent is a headless TypeScript agent runtime. One process serves one
**profile**: a directory with a YAML config, a persona (`SOUL.md`,
`IDENTITY.md`), skills, and private SQLite state. Ardent runs model turns
against an OpenAI-compatible chat server (llama.cpp, vLLM, ...) or the Codex
App Server, calls typed tools, and keeps a durable journal of every task.

What you get:

- **Durable tasks** with idempotency keys, cancellation, deadlines, and a
  per-task event journal in SQLite. Interrupted work is marked `unknown`,
  never silently replayed.
- **Management API** (Hono, bearer-token protected) for tasks, sessions,
  config, identity, skills, peers, channels, and live event streams. The
  OpenAPI document is served at `/openapi.json` and pinned in
  [`openapi/ardent.json`](openapi/ardent.json).
- **A2A protocol 1.0** server and client over JSON-RPC, HTTP+JSON, and gRPC,
  with authenticated peers, push notifications, and bounded "team missions"
  that scope which tools a peer may reach.
- **Scheduled jobs** (cron with IANA timezones, or fixed intervals) with
  exactly-once window receipts.
- **Skills**: Markdown working methods the model can read on demand.
- **Context compaction** for long sessions, driven by a model policy file.
- **Optional integrations**: news research (SearXNG + Firecrawl), HiveMem
  long-term memory, Telegram and Mattermost chat channels, read-only Magnus
  Control tools, and Hermes Agent team-card compatibility. Each one is off
  until you configure it.
- **Plugins**: add tools, API routes, CLI commands, and job handlers from a
  separate npm package.

## Install

Ardent needs Node.js 24.22.1+ or 26.13.0+ (`better-sqlite3` is a native
dependency).

```bash
npm i -g @hivemagnus/ardent
ardent init --non-interactive            # creates ~/.ardent/profiles/assistant
ardent doctor                            # lists unresolved configuration
```

`init` copies the bundled `assistant` template, sets the profile timezone to
the host's zone, and writes a random management token to the profile's
`.env`. Use `--profile NAME` (or `--profile-path /abs/dir`) to create and
select other profiles, and `--api-port N` to choose the management port.
`ARDENT_HOME` overrides the `~/.ardent` root.

Point the profile at a model, then talk to it:

```bash
cat >> ~/.ardent/profiles/assistant/.env <<'EOF'
ARDENT_LLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080/
ARDENT_LLAMA_MODEL=your-model-name
EOF
ardent chat                              # interactive session
ardent run --prompt "Summarize RFC 9110 in three bullets"
ardent gateway run                       # management API, A2A, channels, jobs
```

`ardent help` lists every command.

## Configuration

`config.yaml` (schema 1) is validated strictly; unknown keys are rejected. A
string of the form `${NAME}` is resolved from the environment (the profile
`.env` is loaded automatically). Secrets are never written to the config,
only the *names* of the environment variables that hold them.

| Key | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `profile`, `name` | required | Profile ID and display name. |
| `product` | `Ardent` | Shown in the profile summary. |
| `timezone` | host zone, else `UTC` | IANA zone used for dates shown to the model. Job schedules carry their own zone. |
| `identity.soul_file`, `identity.identity_file` | `SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md` | Persona files in the profile. |
| `execution` | required | `backend: llamacpp \| codex`, step, tool-call, parallelism, and deadline limits. |
| `providers.llamacpp` | required | `base_url`, `model`, `api_key_env`, `request_timeout_seconds`, optional `context_window_tokens`, `max_output_tokens`, `reasoning_effort`. |
| `providers.codex` | required | `command`, `model`, `auth_mode: chatgpt \| api_key` (default `chatgpt`); `approval_policy: never` and `sandbox: read-only` are fixed. |
| `memory` | `{ provider: none }` | See [HiveMem](#hivemem-memory). |
| `research` | disabled | `enabled`, `searxng_url`, `firecrawl_url`, `firecrawl_token_env`. Enables the `news_search`, `news_article`, `news_collect`, and `news_capabilities` tools. |
| `skills` | `directories: [skills]`, `enabled: []` | Only enabled skills are shown to the model. |
| `a2a` | disabled | See [A2A](#a2a). |
| `channels.telegram`, `channels.mattermost` | disabled | See [Chat channels](#chat-channels). |
| `integrations.magnus_control` | disabled | See [Magnus Control tools](#magnus-control-tools). |
| `plugins` | `[]` | See [Plugins](#plugins). |
| `api` | `127.0.0.1:9910`, `ARDENT_API_TOKEN` | Management listener and the env var holding its bearer token. A non-loopback host is refused; put a TLS proxy in front instead. |

`ardent config schema` prints the full JSON Schema, and `ardent config
validate` checks a profile without starting it.

### HiveMem memory

Memory is off by default. To use a HiveMem server:

```yaml
memory:
  provider: hivemem
  base_url: ${HIVEMEM_API_URL}
  token_env: HIVEMEM_TOKEN
  agent_id: assistant
  workspace_id: ${HIVEMEM_WORKSPACE}
  default_scope: private
```

Direct conversations then get `hivemem_status`, `hivemem_search`,
`hivemem_browse`, and explicit write tools. Peers never read private memory; a
validated team mission may grant read access to one shared `project:<id>`
scope.

### Chat channels

```yaml
channels:
  telegram:
    enabled: true
    token_env: TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
    allowed_user_ids: [123456789]     # only these users are answered
  mattermost:
    enabled: true
    base_url: ${MATTERMOST_URL}       # e.g. https://chat.example.com
    token_env: MATTERMOST_TOKEN
    allowed_user_ids: [user-id]
    require_mention: true
    reply_mode: thread                # thread | flat
```

Telegram uses long polling; Mattermost uses its v4 REST and WebSocket APIs.
Both support `/help`, `/new`, `/status`, `/jobs`, `/model`, `/stop`, `/tasks`,
and `/sources`. Each inbound message and outbound reply is journaled, so a
restart never sends the same reply twice.

### A2A

```yaml
a2a:
  enabled: true
  bindings: [jsonrpc, http-json, grpc]
  public_url: ${ARDENT_A2A_PUBLIC_URL}   # advertised origin, e.g. https://agent.example.com:9900
  listen_host: 127.0.0.1
  listen_port: 9900                      # gRPC listens on listen_port + 1
  peers_file: peers.yaml
  skill: { id: research, name: Research, description: Sourced answers, tags: [research] }
  hermes_compat: false
```

Peers are listed in `peers.yaml` with the environment variables holding their
inbound and outbound bearer tokens. An ordinary peer task can reach only the
public news tools. A peer that sends a validated team mission envelope gets
the tools its `resources` allow (`public:news`, `magnus:fleet`,
`magnus:node:<id>`, or `tool:<name>` for any registered tool) and must return
a structured, evidence-checked team result.

`hermes_compat: true` additionally serves the authenticated
`/.well-known/hermes-team-card.json` discovery document and accepts Hermes
Agent's slash-style JSON-RPC method aliases (`message/send`, `tasks/get`, ...).

`ardent a2a discover <peer>` and `ardent a2a call <peer> --prompt TEXT` talk
to configured peers from the command line.

### Magnus Control tools

Read-only fleet tools for a [Magnus](https://github.com/ChefTaco/magnus)
Control API (fleet inventory, readiness, node health, dependency impact,
anomalies, command status, and more). Enable them with
`integrations.magnus_control.enabled: true` or `ARDENT_MAGNUS_CONTROL_TOOLS=true`.
The base URL comes only from `integrations.magnus_control.base_url` (default
`${ARDENT_MAGNUS_API_URL}`) and the read token from the env var named by
`token_env` (default `ARDENT_MAGNUS_READ_TOKEN`). Bearer tokens are sent only
over HTTPS or to loopback.

### Scheduled jobs

Put job definitions in `jobs/active.json` inside the profile:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1, "profile": "assistant", "revision": 1,
  "jobs": [{
    "id": "morning-news", "owner": "ardent", "enabled": true, "handler": "news.collect",
    "schedule": { "cron": "30 6 * * *", "timezone": "Europe/Berlin", "missed_window": "skip", "catch_up_minutes": 0 },
    "input": { "query": "open source AI agents", "max_articles": 3 },
    "delivery": { "kind": "none" },
    "policy": { "max_attempts": 2, "retry_backoff_seconds": 300 }
  }]
}
```

`ardent jobs definitions validate --source /abs/path.json` checks a file
before you install it; `ardent jobs definitions status` and
`GET /api/v1/jobs/definitions/status` report the installed revision and recent
windows. The built-in handler is `news.collect` (requires `research`); plugins
add more.

### Model policy

An optional, owner-only `$ARDENT_HOME/model-policy/active.json` selects the
Codex model and reasoning effort and configures context compaction for all
profiles under that home. [`model-policy.default.json`](model-policy.default.json)
is a starting point; compaction is disabled until you enable it.

## Plugins

A plugin is an ES module whose default export (or named `plugin` export) is an
`ArdentPlugin` object, or an array of them:

```ts
import { definePlugin } from '@hivemagnus/ardent';
import { z } from 'zod';

export default definePlugin({
  name: 'weather',
  registerTools(ctx) {
    ctx.tools.register(ctx.defineTool({
      name: 'weather_now', description: 'Current weather for a city.',
      input: z.object({ city: z.string().min(1) }).strict(),
      output: z.object({ summary: z.string() }),
      effect: 'read', contexts: ['direct'], timeoutMs: 10_000,
      handler: async ({ city }, signal) => ({ summary: await lookUp(city, signal) }),
    }));
  },
  routes(app, ctx) {                       // served under /api/v1/plugins/weather/
    app.get('/health', c => c.json({ ok: true, profile: ctx.config.profile }));
  },
  cliCommands: {                           // ardent weather-check
    'weather-check': { description: 'Probe the provider', run: async ({ print }) => print({ ok: true }) },
  },
  jobHandlers: ctx => ({ /* 'weather.daily': JobHandler */ }),
  jobOwnership: ctx => async (job, now) => { /* throw to refuse a job window */ },
  peerTool: (tool, task, envelope) => false, // allow a peer to call one of your tools
});
```

Load it from config, as an npm package name (resolved from the profile
directory first, then from Ardent's own install), an absolute path, or a
`file://` URL:

```yaml
plugins: ['@example/ardent-weather', /opt/ardent/plugins/local.mjs]
```

Embedders that build the runtime themselves can call `registerPlugin()` before
loading plugins. Plugin tools join the profile's shared tool registry; a tool's
`contexts` decides whether direct, peer, or scheduled tasks may call it, and a
peer still needs an explicit mission grant (`tool:<name>`) or `peerTool`.
Plugin routes sit behind the same bearer-token check as the rest of the
management API.

## Security model

- The model never gets a shell, deployment, or credential tool from Ardent
  itself. Retrieved text, memories, and peer messages are treated as data.
- Every tool declares its effect (`read`, `artifact-write`, `memory-write`,
  `external-write`). A cancelled task whose tool call may have had an effect
  is marked `unknown`, not `cancelled`, and is never retried automatically.
- Profile state, `.env`, and config are created owner-only (`0600`/`0700`).
- News URLs are restricted to public HTTP(S) addresses; private and loopback
  ranges are refused.
